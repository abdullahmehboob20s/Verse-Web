          The Utherverse is an interoperable hub where many worlds can
          interconnect and exist via a system of permissions. These interlaced
          permissions act as an access control layer between worlds, to govern
          experience or game play, physics, avatars, or authenticate NFTâ€™s and
          connected wallets.

        <p className="fs-16px leading-[1.7] font-normal mb-5 text-white">
          This sets up a matrix of checks and balances, that enables us to
          manage scammers, spammers, thieves and frauds, as well as adjudicate
          disputed financial transactions. When users cross borders between
          worlds, their holdings are cross referenced and database queried on
          the Utherverse system. Their goods can then be authenticated, fraud
          detected, and permissions adjusted.
