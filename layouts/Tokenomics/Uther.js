          UTHER is a unique token offering because it is designed to offer real
          and necessary utility across the Utherverse platform, and because it
          is being deployed in a third-generation version of the most successful
          metaverse platform in history.

          The long and successful track-record of the Company, our technology

          managing a massive virtual economy put the UTHER Coin in a category of
          its own.
